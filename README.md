# NHS: Utilisation & Capacity Analysis- 89% final grade.

### Project Summary: 
The second fictional project involved the NHS. The project was aimed at addressing the abstract issues of adequate capacity and utilisation within the system by considering appointment data. Through rigorous data analysis, we identified key areas for improvement: optimising resource allocation, forecasting health trends, and improving patient care services.

### Analytical Approach Highlights:
- Data Consolidation and Integrity: Focused on data quality and standardisation, highlighting skills in using metadata to identify and correct data issues. Demonstrated proficiency in consolidating data sets, ensuring accuracy and reliability in analysis outcomes.
- TimeSeries for Predictive Forecasting: Illustrates proficiency in TimeSeries analysis, utilising Python libraries for forecasting. This skill is essential for predicting trends and making data-driven decisions, showcasing an ability to handle and analyse time based data effectively.
- Research: Emphasises on the ability to conduct thorough research, integrating findings from a wide range of sources including 44 references. This skill ensured a well-rounded analysis, grounded in evidence and diverse perspectives.
- Targeted insights: Demonstrates the ability to translate complex data into actionable insights justified by strong research, focusing on strategic recommendations based on data analysis. Highlights a results-oriented approach, essential for addressing business challenges effectively.

### Key Insights and Recommendations:
- Analysed NHS data revealing 65% average utilisation rate during a long period that included Covid, identifying potential underutilisation and capacity expansion opportunities. 
- Raised data concerns by addressing metadata and data quality issues, affecting 13% of appointments, equating to approximately 38,971,612 appointments with data inconsistencies. 
- Utilised Python for data manipulation and visualisation, creating over 20 graphs to elucidate insights on NHS capacity and resource utilisation.
- Identified regional discrepancies in NHS appointment allocations, directly correlating to population representation, leading to potential location based recommendations for resource reallocation.
- Created crude bespoke sentiment analysis tool for use on Twitter data, filtering through keywords and hashtags to evaluate public sentiment, identifying opportunities for service improvement and potential future usage. 
- Developed strategic recommendations to increase NHS appointment availability through optimising thoroughly researched appointment delivery methods.
- Identified missed appointment costs of approximately Â£927 million over 18 months, underscoring the financial impact of data quality and patient attendance.


### Professional Development and Impact: 
This project underscored my proficiency in leveraging advanced analytics, research, and data visualisation techniques to drive significant potential improvements for the NHS. The initiative not only showcased my technical acumen but also highlighted my ability to translate data insights into actionable strategies that enhance service delivery and operational efficiency.
